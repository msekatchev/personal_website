		Until the end of the 2018 school year, I went to an international school in Manosque, France: <a href="http://www.ecole-internationale.ac-aix-marseille.fr/webphp/eipaca/index.php/en" target="_blank">Ecole Internationale Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur</a>. I first began this school when I moved to France in 2010, in CM1 (= Grade 4), and in 2012 I went to highschool (S1 = grade 6) at the same school. This is a school for students from 35 nations participating in the <a href="https://www.iter.org" target="_blank">ITER</a> project. <br>There, I follow the European Baccalaureate (EB) system (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Baccalaureate" target="_blank">read more</a>). <br><br>
		Most classes are taught in English (around 80%), and the rest in French (20%), and a third language is required when going into S2 (= grade 6 in the Canadian curriculum). My third (fourth incl. Russian) language was Spanish. I studied it from S2-S5, but I could not continue taking it in S6 as that would exceed the maximum number of periods.<br><br>
		Students are taught a wide spectrum of courses, which slowly narrow down into 3 categories by the beginning on S6 (= grade 11): <ul><li>Sciences (S)</li></ul><ul><li>Social Sciences (Sc)</li></ul><ul><li>Languages/Art (LA)</li></ul>
		My last year at EIPACA was S6 (the equivalent of Grade 11 in the Canadian curriculum), and I took a scientific-oriented path, choosing the following courses (P meaning periods/week. 1 period = 45 minutes):
		<ol>Compulsory for S:
<li>Language I - English - 4P</li>
<li>Language II - French - 3P</li>
<li>Mathematics - 5P</li>
<li>Ethiscs - 1P</li>
<li>Physical Educaiton - 2P</li>
<li>History - 2P</li>
<li>Geography - 2P</li>
<li>Philosophy - 2P</li><br>

Options:
<li>Physics - 4P</li>
<li>Chemistry - 4P</li>
<li>Higher Level Mathematics - 3P</li>
<li>Lab Sciences - 2P</li><br>


		</ol>Total: 33 Periods / week.<br><br>All of my marks will be provided upon request. <br><br><br>

		When I was in S4 (= grade 9), I was elected class representative, and throughout the school year had responsibilities, such as helping other classmates and teachers during free time.<br>
		Twice a year, along with the other class representative, I presented the class' ideas and suggestions to the school's director and other staff. I presented their replies to the students.<br><br><br>
		From S2 - S5, I took part in the yearbook club - a club responsible for the entire process of designing, creating, editing, and finally printing and selling each year's yearbook. In S3 (= grade 8), I headed the club, directing the 20+ participating students.<br><br>
		In 2018 (in S6), I, along with 2 others from my class, became head directors of the yearbook club, lead the club and organised all of its activities and milestones. I mainly assisted in contacting the printer and organized the entire printing process, creating a total of 600 copies which I then assisted in selling and distributing.<br><br>

		<br><br>


		As well as my help in the yearbook club, I also frequently assisted at the "Kermesse", a spring fare held by the school every year to raise money for developping schools in South Africa. In 2018, I assisted at the drinks stand (most successful stand at the fare), helping sell refreshing drinks. This gave me practical experience and taught me to deal with customers, as well as advertise and communicate effectively and popularize our stand, while also working for a very important cause. <br><br><br>

		In the same year, I took part a science project (which was entered in a national French competition), creating a braille sensor to train blind children to read braille. Not only was this valuable experience in project management, organization, and budget management (we were given 100 euros for the project), it was for a good cause. We created a video showcasing the project, which was sent to the competition in Paris. You can watch it <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/kL3b9KWiNZloMvqp8SD" target="_blank">Here</a>. The video is in french.
